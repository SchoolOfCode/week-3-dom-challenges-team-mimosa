/*
Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand and utilize DOM element selection.
  2. Implement mouse event listeners.
  3. Manipulate CSS properties through JavaScript.

Brief:
Chris is eager to perform a magic trick â€” to vanish before your eyes! By harnessing the power of CSS and JavaScript, make Chris disappear when the mouse hovers over his image. 

Expected Outcomes:
  1. When the user hovers over Chris's image, he should disappear.
  2. When the user moves the mouse away, Chris should reappear.

Hint: You can achieve this in multiple ways e.g. via the opacity or style property, etc.

// Place your plan and solution below!

//Grab the image
const chris_image = document.getElementById("chrisImage");

//create function to reduce opacity
function makeChrisDisappear() {
  chris_image.style.opacity = 0;
}

//create function to increase opacity
function makeChrisAppear(){
  chris_image.style.opacity = 1;
}

//create an event listner that responds to hovering
chris_image.addEventListener("mouseenter",makeChrisDisappear);

//create an event listner that responds to hovering
chris_image.addEventListener("mouseleave",makeChrisAppear);
